# Moy_PA4
Moy_p1 - I create 2 classes: Application and DuplicateRemover. DuplicateRemover reads a .txt file and removes all the duplicate words and writes all the unique 
words into a HashSet(HashSets don't allow duplicates, so it was the easiest way to store all the unique words.). It then prints the unique words to another .txt file. The Application 
class creates an instance of DuplicateRemover and calls DuplicateRemoer's functions to do ias described above.

Moy_p2 - Created 2 class: DuplicateCounter and Application. Duplicate counter reads in a list of words from a .txt file and counts every instance of each word, by 
storing the word in a HashMap where the key is the word and the value is how many copies of the word exist in the file. It also contains a print function that will 
write all the words and how many copies exist to a .txt file. Application serves the same purpose here as it did in Moy_p1.
